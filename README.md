# Galvanize API

This API was created by Galvanize to be used in our assignments. I made modifications that fix mistakes and add features.

### Usage

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### External API's

The `/app/randomImage.js` route uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to generate a URL for a random photo.
